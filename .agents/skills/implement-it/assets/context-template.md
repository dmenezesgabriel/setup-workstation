# Project Context

This file defines the domain vocabulary for this project. Both plan-it and implement-it read it at session start to use consistent terminology in task names, requirements, acceptance criteria, test names, and code.

Update this file when a domain term is first defined or clarified. Do not batch updates — add terms as they emerge.

## Domain terms

<!--
Each entry follows this format:

### <Term>

**Definition**: One sentence. What it means in this project specifically.
**Usage**: How it appears in code, APIs, tasks, or the UI (e.g., model name, route prefix, event name).
**Constraints**: Key rules that apply to this term (optional).

-->

### Example: Project

**Definition**: A named workspace owned by one user that groups members, tasks, and settings.
**Usage**: `Project` model, `POST /projects` route, "project" in all task and requirement text.
**Constraints**: A project must have an owner; it cannot exist without one.

### Example: Member

**Definition**: A user who belongs to a project with a role (owner, admin, or member).
**Usage**: `ProjectMember` join model, "member" in invitation and permission task text.
**Constraints**: Roles are: owner (one per project), admin, member. Permissions differ per role.

## Decisions and constraints

<!--
Record cross-cutting decisions that are not captured in an ADR but affect naming, behavior, or conventions.
-->

### Example: API error format

All API errors use `{ code: string, message: string, field?: string }`. Use this shape in all task requirements and acceptance criteria involving validation or error handling.

---

## Out of scope

<!--
Record what this project explicitly does not do, to avoid re-litigating decisions in planning sessions.
-->

<!-- Example: This project does not support multi-tenancy. All data is scoped to a single organization. -->
